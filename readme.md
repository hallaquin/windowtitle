# Geometry Dash Window Title Mod 🔄  
[Español]()
Modifies the Geometry Dash window title to display real-time information about the level you're playing.  
Here's our logo (hover to see the title text):  

Example: *("Acu by Neigefeu (75%) - Geometry Dash")*  

## ✨ Features  
- Dynamically displays in the window title:  
  - Level name  
  - Level creator  
  - Current progress percentage  
- Format: `[Name] by [Creator] ([Current%]) - Geometry Dash`  
- Real-time updates while playing  
- Reverts to the default title when not in a level  
- Compatible with:  
  - Official levels  
  - User-created levels  
  - Demon list/daily levels  

## ❌ Original Problem  
When streaming Geometry Dash on **OBS**, the window title only showed _"Geometry Dash"_, making it impossible to manage my clips properly.  

## ⚙️ Installation  
1. Download the file `hallacadotsvp.window_title.geode`  
2. Place it in the `Geometry Dash/geode/mods/` folder  
3. Launch Geometry Dash  

## 📝 Requirements

## 🐧 Linux  
- Should work fully with Wine, though it hasn't been tested.  

## 📜 To Do:
